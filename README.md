# Cloudberry

A web mail client written in Clojure(Script).

Attempts to follow the data-flow described in this Christian Johansen's article [Stateless, data-driven UIs](https://cjohansen.no/stateless-data-driven-uis/)

## Explanation of render cycle

Basically, it goes like this:
1. `render!` is called with empty global state and an initial component
2. A global event handler is defined, which listens for any events (like a text input)
3. The handler iterates the events along corresponding data (like the action)
4. `handle-action` returns a new state depending on the action and
payload
5. (optional) If the action begins with `:api`, it'll be treated differently by making the API call and getting new data which will be merged into the new state
6. The global state is replaced by the new state
7. Re-render happens and all components load


1. `render!` is called with empty global state and an initial component, creating the initial UI.
2. A global event handler is defined to listen for UI events (e.g., clicks, input changes).
3. When a user interacts with the UI, it triggers an event captured by the global handler.
4. The handler processes each action and generates a new state. This is done by the pure `handle-action` function. **\***
5. The global state atom (store) is updated with the new state.
6. The store watcher detects the state change and triggers a re-render.
7. All components are re-rendered based on the new state, updating the UI.

**\*** *There is an additional step for API calls: the event handler checks for actions with the `:api` namespace (e.g., :api/make-request) and routes them to a separate function (`perform-api-call!`) for handling asynchronous API requests.*

## Usage

FIXME: provide a deps.edn command to compile shadow-cljs first and start the backend
